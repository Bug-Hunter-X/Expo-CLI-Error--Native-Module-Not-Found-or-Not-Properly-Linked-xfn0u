This error occurs when you try to use a feature from a package that isn't properly installed or linked in your Expo project. This commonly happens with native modules or packages that require linking to native iOS or Android code.  For example, if you try to use a camera library without correctly following its Expo installation instructions, you might see an error related to native modules being undefined or unavailable.  This can also occur if you have conflicting package versions or incomplete installations.  Check for messages indicating that a native module isn't linked or isn't available for your platform (iOS/Android).
