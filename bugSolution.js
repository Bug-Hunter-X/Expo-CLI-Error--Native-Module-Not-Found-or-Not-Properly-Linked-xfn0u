This solution assumes the problematic package is `react-native-camera`.  Replace it with your specific package if necessary.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
// Correct installation and potential linking (if required)
expo install expo-camera
// ... (Ensure the package's installation instructions are fully followed) 

import { Camera } from 'expo-camera'; //Correct import statement

// ...rest of your code using the camera
```

This revised code demonstrates the correct method of installing and importing the `expo-camera` package, avoiding the native module error. Always refer to the specific package's documentation for the most accurate installation and usage instructions.
